    "Background:  With the improvement of society, people care more about their personal health and are willing to spend more money on health insurance. Medical costs may be affected by factors such as age, sex, and so on. Out of interest in this topic, our group selected this data set to make an analysis.\n",

    "Data Overview: The data set contains one response variable, “charges”; and six explanatory variables, which are “age”, “sex”, “bmi”(Body mass index), “children”, “smoker”, and “region”, repectively. “Age”, “bmi” and “children” are continuous variables, and the other three variables are categorical. The factor “sex” and “smoker” have two levels, and the factor “region” has 4 levels. \n",
    "A linear regression model will be fitted to the dataset and we are going to explore how the different variables affect the model. Model selection methods will be applied in order to find the best model to make predictions."

We will use some parameters like R^2, adjusted R^2, Cp, BIC… to see if our model fits the data well and do some tests (ep. F-test) to decide what model we should use. We expect to build a MLR model which could accurately predict a person’s medical costs given some inputs (personal information).
